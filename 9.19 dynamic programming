those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
remember what you do in sub problems, save time
two ways: from top to bottom,  from bottom to top
from top to bottom: use memorandom to record the value you already have calculated
This method still has to calculate fib(1), fib(2), fib(3), why don't calculate these values first,

That's from bottom to top, firstly solve subproblems.
from bottom to top: use array to store the result calculated, for later cycle use, but the cycle only occurs in three number.
 for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)
        {
            Memo_i=Memo_i_2+Memo_i_1;
            Memo_i_2=Memo_i_1;
            Memo_i_1=Memo_i;
        }  

if a problem is fit for DP, if it needs to gain optimal solve, its subproblem must also gain optimal solve.
